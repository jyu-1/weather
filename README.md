# Weather App

This project is utilizing the open weather API to provide us with weather data
We will then fetch these data with fetch() in Javascript
Async and await will also be used to implement promise so our application can be asynchronous

# Limitation with the OpenWeatherMap Free API

Due to the limitation of the free API, many useful forecast info such as daily high/low and hourly forecast are not available.
The only forecast that is available is every 3 hours up to 5 days.
