# Weather App

This project is utilizing the OpenWeatherMap API to provide us with weather data.\
Async and await will be used to implement promise so our application can be asynchronous.\
Features the ability to search the weather data from any city in the world.\
Default unit is Fahrenheit, but can be changed to Celsius by clicking the button to the right of the search bar.

## Limitation with the OpenWeatherMap Free API

Due to the limitation of the free API, many useful forecast info such as daily high/low and hourly forecast are not available.\
The free API provides forecast data of every 3 hours up to 5 days.
